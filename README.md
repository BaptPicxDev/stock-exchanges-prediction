In this repository, I implement a Stock Exchange prediction. 
For this prediction, I use information from previous price stock (Low, High, Close...)
These information will helps you to make decision (Buy/Sell). 
Indeed, this prediction is linked to my other repository : stock-exchanges-tool 

I developp this project in python.
Modules : Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Json
